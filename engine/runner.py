# Given a keyword

# Grab the first 10 page of google (Can use the google package)

# For each link, get the textual content of the page

# Maintain a blacklist (Reddit/Something else -> Then increase the counter) (Checkpoint)

# Grab the content -> Generate a quick summary -> 10 point per article (Checkpoint)

# For each article summary -> Check if there is a overlap with other article summaries in the list(Clustering?) (Check point)

# Mark them as important -> Put it in a separate bucket (Checkpoint)

# Generate the outline (Check point)

# Step 2: Loop through search results and process each page
